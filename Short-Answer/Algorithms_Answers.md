#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This would be Linear 0(n) because the run time will increase with the size of the input data


b) This would be Quadratic 0(n^2) because it has a nested loop within a loop


c) This would be Linear 0(n) because it’s a recursive call on each item within bunnies

## Exercise II

For this I would implement a Binary Search. 

First start at the midpoint of the n-story building.

If the egg doesn’t break at the midpoint go up from there 
until a floor is reached where the egg breaks.

Else if go below the midpoint by going down one floor each time until a floor is reach where the egg does not break

This will determine the floor at which the egg will be broken with a runtime of Logarithmic 0(log n)
